summary: 
---
With the financial assistance of the Government of Japan, UNCRD has been providing needed technical assistance to the Department of Environment (DoE)/Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF)-Bangladesh to develop its national 3R strategy since the inception of the process in December 2008.   
   
A series of national stakeholders meetings have been held in the process of formulating the national strategy in order to make the process highly participatory and consultative, and to ensure local ownership. The meetings have involved a wide range of stakeholders including national and local government representatives, research institutions, NGOs, and private/business sectors.   
   
After the two consecutive national stakeholders consultation meetings held in September and November 2009, the draft strategy had been updated by incorporating the different comments and suggestions received from the stakeholders present at these meetings. This third and final meeting was held to review and discuss the third draft strategy for further improvement and was jointly organized by UNCRD and DoE/MoEF-Bangladesh on 20 June 2010 in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The meeting was attended by the representatives of relevant ministries, government agencies, corporations, municipalities, business associations, NGOs, and academia.   
   
UNCRD facilitated the consultation and provided input/comments on the third draft strategy. UNCRD also introduced the outcome of the 18th Session of the Commission for Sustainable Development (CSD-18) in the waste management sector such as a zero waste economy, recognizing waste as a resource, and waste prevention and minimization as valuable concepts to guide action on waste management.  
   
The meeting recognized the growing interest among stakeholders on the need for 3Rs in place of conventional waste management practices that has failed to keep in pace with the increasing volume and diversification of waste streams.  
   
The meeting recommended Waste Concern (designated national collaboration centre for preparing the draft strategy) and DoE (implementing office) to complete the final draft strategy by August 2010 incorporating all the suggestions made by different stakeholders, participants, and UNCRD.   
   
The final strategy was officially launched in December 2010.
