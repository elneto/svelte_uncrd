With the financial assistance of the Ministry of the Environment, Government of Japan (MOEJ) and Asian Development Bank (ADB), UNCRD has been providing needed technical assistance to the Institute of Strategy and Policy on Natural Resources and Environment (ISPONRE)/Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE), Viet Nam to mainstream 3Rs in Viet Nam. MONRE has developed a draft national strategy on waste reduction, reuse, and recycle (the 3Rs). The national 3R strategy has been formulated, and has become an integral part of the "National Strategy of Integrated Solid Waste Management to 2025, vision to 2050", that has been approved by the Prime Minister of Viet Nam via official decision no. 2149/QD-TTg dated 17 December 2009.  
   
In this connection, a national workshop (In-country Training Workshop-cum-Policy Dialogue on the National Strategy for Integrated Solid Waste Management/3R on 27 July) and a regional workshop (The Greater Mekong Sub-Region Workshop on the National Strategy for Integrated Solid Waste Management and 3Rs on 28-29 July) were co-organized by the ISPONRE/MONRE-Viet Nam, UNCRD, and Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES), with the support of ADB and MoE-Japan, at Do Son in Hai Phong City, Viet Nam.   
   
The two workshops aimed at sharing and disseminating the key findings and lessons learned from Viet Namfs strategy. At the same time, the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) workshop was expected to help assess the desirability and interest of other GMS countries to implement similar initiatives and exercises on the 3Rs. It also helped to generate consensus among GMS countries towards furthering the 3R objectives and principles in the sub-region. The workshop adopted the Chairfs Summary in order to help build the necessary political will to address common issues of concern, including transboundary issues in relation to hazardous/e-wastes.
