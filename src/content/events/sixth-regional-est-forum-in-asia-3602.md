UNCRD, jointly with the Ministry of Urban Development (MOUD)-India, WHO/SEARO, and Ministry of the Environment of Japan (MOEJ), co-organized the Sixth Regional Environmentally Sustainable Transport (EST) Forum in Asia in conjunction with [Urban Mobility India 2011](http://urbanmobilityindia.in/Conference/Archive.aspx) as an integrated event titled **"Conference cum Exhibition on Sustainable Mobility"** from 4 to 6 December 2011 at the Manekshaw Center, New Delhi, India.  
   
The annually held Regional EST Forum in Asia organized by UNCRD provides a strategic and knowledge platform for sharing experiences and disseminating best practices, policy instruments, tools, and technologies among Asian countries in relation to the various key aspects of EST underlined in the Aichi Statement (2005). The Urban Mobility India (UMI) Conference cum Exhibition is an annual flagship event of the MOUD-India, organized since 2008 in order to encourage states and cities to reform their urban transport systems by disseminating information and facilitating exchange of ideas, and by recognizing good urban transport initiatives with the Urban Mobility Awards.  
   
The Conference reviewed and shared the progress made by Asian countries in various aspects of sustainable transport, including road safety, connectivity, and inclusiveness. The Sixth Regional EST Forum focused on the implementation of the [Bangkok 2020 Declaration](content/documents/201008_Bangkok-Declaration.pdf) agreed upon at the Fifth Regional EST Forum last year and addressed a range of sustainability issues in urban transport, including innovative financing. It was observed that the Asian EST Forum member countries have started to re-orient their overall transport policy, planning, and development in order to implement the twenty goals of the [Bangkok 2020 Declaration](content/documents/201008_Bangkok-Declaration.pdf) under the three key strategic approaches - **Avoid**, **Shift**, **Improve** - by which they have also geared their economy towards a green economy, characterized by low carbon, energy/fuel efficient, and socially inclusive. The representatives from the twenty-one Asian countries adopted a [Chair's Summary](content/documents/6EST-Chair-Summary.pdf), which aims to contribute to enrich the discussion on sustainable transport at the [Rio+20](http://www.uncsd2012.org/rio20/), a process in the context of moving towards a green economy. The Conference requested the Government of India to submit the Chair's Summary to the secretariat of the [Rio+20](http://www.uncsd2012.org/rio20/).
