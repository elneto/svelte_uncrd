The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE), and the Ministry of Transport (MOT) of the Government of Viet Nam officially completed the [National Environment Sustainable Transport (EST) Strategy](content/documents/Viet-Nam_NESTS.pdf) in March 2012 in Ha Noi, Viet Nam.   
   
The Viet Nam National EST Strategy is aiming to ensure the sustainable development of road transport to meet socio-economic development demands while simultaneously achieving environmental protection goals, and contributing to the country's sustainable development and improvement of people's quality of life. Based on six view points, the Viet Nam National EST Strategy set up 10 specific targets to be achieved by 2020, and proposed 22 programmes, which are coherent with Bangkok 2020 Declaration adopted in the fifth Regional EST Forum in 2010.   
   
Under the technical and financial support of UNCRD and Ministry of the Environment, Government of Japan (MOEJ), the Institute of Strategy and Policy on Natural Resources and Environment (IPONRE) was working on developing the National EST Strategy as national collaborating centre that coordinate with MONRE and MOT. A series of national stakeholders' consultation meetings, EST workshops, and national EST training course were organized to involve government officials from line ministries and agencies, and experts and scientists in the areas of transport and environment protection, into the strategy formulation process, in order to make this strategy more feasible.   
   
This comprehensive strategy is expected to provide a meaningful basis for the government agencies and stakeholders concerned, at central and local levels, for policy-makers, and for researchers on environment and transport to work towards realizing EST in Viet Nam
