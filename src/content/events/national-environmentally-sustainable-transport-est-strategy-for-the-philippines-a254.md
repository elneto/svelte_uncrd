The Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) of the Government of the Philippines officially launched the the [National Environmentally Sustainable Transport (EST) Strategy](content/documents/Philippine_NESTS.pdf) on 20 May 2011 in Manila, Philippines.   
   
The EST Strategy has two objectives:   
  
2. To reduce the annual growth rate of energy consumption and associated green house gas (GHG) and air pollutant emissions from the transport sector in urban areas of the country; and
  
4. To achieve sustainable mobility through the development of a viable market for environmentally sustainable transport (EST) goods and services, which includes promoting transportation systems of low carbon intensity and shifting towards the use of more sustainable transport modes.

   
   
Under the technical and financial support of UNCRD, CAI-Asia (through ADB-SUMA Project), and Ministry of the Environment, government of Japan (MOEJ), the National Center for Transportation Studies of the University of the Philippines (UP NCTS), the officially designated national collaborating center (NCC), prepared the National EST Strategy in close coordination with two EST focal points in the Government of the Philippines: Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) and Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).  
   
Since the inception of the process in September 2008, the National EST Strategy had been reviewed and developed in a highly participatory and consultative process through a series of national stakeholders consultation meetings, including three regional consultations held in Iloilo, Davao, and Baguio.  
   
Philippines Presidential Administrative Order No. 254 (dated 30 January 2009) to mandate DOTC to take the lead in formulating a Strategy also attached importance to the development of the National EST Strategy.  
   
This comprehensive strategy is expected to serve as a national guideline for changing the country's transport policies into more people- and environment-friendly ones and to contribute to achieving the Sustainable Transport Goals set forth in the [Bangkok 2020 Declaration](content/documents/201008_Bangkok-Declaration.pdf), which is an important regional consensus agreed upon at the Fifth Regional EST Forum in Asia held in August 2010.  
   
The Strategy is also expected to provide an important basis and framework to develop and realize relevant EST activities as nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) to take full benefit of the international support available in addressing the climate issues.
